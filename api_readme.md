# WCS Points API

The WCS Points API is used to manage WCS members' points and facilitate sign-in for events, office hours, and more.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository, then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```
It will start up on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000). You can then make API calls through an application like [Postman](https://getpostman.com).

## API Calls

There are four routes: `events`, `users`, `events/:id`, `users/:id`. The first two calls are used for getting information about all the events or users that exist in the database. For details about a specific event or user, use the last two calls.

### List all WCS events

```
GET events
```
#### Response

```
{
    "message": "OK",
    "data": [
        {
            "_id": "id_string",
            "name": "event_name",
            "points": 1,
            "__v": 3,
            "key": "event_key",
            "category": "event_category",
            "attendees": [
                "user1",
                "user2"
            ],
            "date": "2018-09-06T00:00:00.000Z",
            "expiration": "2018-09-06T02:00:00.000Z",
            "dateCreated": "2018-09-12T20:32:44.438Z"
        }
}
```
### Create an Event
Make a new Event object in the database. `name`, `points`, `date`, `category`, and `password` must be sent in the request body. Upon submitting the request, the system will generate a random passphrase that will be set as the `key`. An `expiration` will also be automatically set to 2 hours after the event start time.
```
POST events
```
#### Response
```
{
    "message": "Event created!",
    "data": {
        "__v": 0,
        "name": "event_name",
        "points": 1,
        "key": "event_key",
        "category": "event_category",
        "_id": "id_string",
        "attendees": [],
        "expiration": "2018-03-28T07:00:00.000Z",
        "date": "2018-03-28T05:00:00.000Z",
        "dateCreated": "2018-12-11T04:18:45.420Z"
    }
}
```
### Getting data about a specific WCS event
The `:id` parameter must be passed through the API call's url. This is the `id_string` associated with each Event object.
```
GET events/:id
```
#### Response
```
{
    "message": "OK",
    "data": {
        "_id": "id_string",
        "name": "event_name",
        "points": 1,
        "key": "event_key",
        "category": "event_category",
        "__v": 0,
        "attendees": [],
        "expiration": "2018-03-28T07:00:00.000Z",
        "date": "2018-03-28T05:00:00.000Z",
        "dateCreated": "2018-12-11T04:18:45.420Z"
    }
}
```
